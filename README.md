## Installation

```
pip install sanpy
```

## Upgrade to latest version

```
pip install --upgrade sanpy
```

## Configuration

Optionally you can provide an api key which gives access to some restricted metrics:

```python
import san
san.ApiConfig.api_key = 'api-key-provided-by-sanbase'
```

To obtain an api key you should [log in to sanbase](https://app.santiment.net/login) and go to the `account` page - [https://app.santiment.net/account](https://app.santiment.net/account). There is an `API Keys` section and a `Generate new api key` button.

If the account used for generating the api key has enough SAN tokens, the api key will give you access to the data that requires SAN token staking. The api key can only be used to fetch data and not to execute graphql mutations.

## Retrieving data from the API

The data is fetched by providing a string in the format `query/slug` and additional parameters.

- `query`: Available queries can be found in section: [Available metrics](#available-metrics)
- `slug`: A list of projects with their slugs, names, etc. can be fetched like this:

```python
import san
san.get("projects/all")
```

```
                name             slug ticker   totalSupply
0             0chain           0chain    ZCN     400000000
1                 0x               0x    ZRX    1000000000
2          0xBitcoin            0xbtc  0xBTC      20999984
...
```

Parameters:

- `from_date`, `to_date` - A date or datetime in iso8601 format specifying the start and end datetime for the returned data for ex: `2018-06-01`
- `interval` - The interval of the returned data - an integer followed by one of: `s`, `m`, `h`, `d` or `w`

Default values for parameters:

- `from_date`: `datetime.now() - 365 days`
- `to_date`: `datetime.now()`
- `interval`: `'1d'`

The returned value for time-series data is in `pandas DataFrame` format indexed by `datetime`.

### Fetch single metric

```python
import san

daa = san.get(
    "daily_active_addresses/santiment",
    from_date="2018-06-01",
    to_date="2018-06-05",
    interval="1d"
)

prices = san.get(
    "prices/santiment",
    from_date="2018-06-01",
    to_date="2018-06-05",
    interval="1d"
)
```

Using the defaults params:

```python
daa = san.get("daily_active_addresses/santiment")
prices = san.get("prices/santiment")
```

### Batching multiple queries

```python
from san import Batch

batch = Batch()
batch.get(
    "daily_active_addresses/santiment",
    from_date="2018-06-01",
    to_date="2018-06-05",
    interval="1d"
)
batch.get(
    "daily_active_addresses/santiment",
    from_date="2018-06-06",
    to_date="2018-06-10",
    interval="1d"
)
[daa1, daa2] = batch.execute()
```

## Available metrics

Below are described some available metrics and are given examples for fetching and for the returned format.

### All Projects

Returns a DataFrame with all the projects available in the Santiment API. Not all
metrics will be available for all the projects. The `slug` is a unique identifier
which can be used to retrieve most of the metrics.

```python
all_projects = san.get("projects/all")
```

Example result:

```
name             slug ticker   totalSupply
0              0chain           0chain    ZCN     400000000

<more results>
```

### ERC20 Projects

Returns a DataFrame with all the ERC20 projects available in the Santiment API.
Not all metrics will be available for all the projects. The `slug` is a unique
identifier which can be used to retrieve most of the metrics.

```python
all_projects = san.get("projects/erc20")
```

Example result:

```
name                   slug ticker   totalSupply
0                   0chain                 0chain    ZCN     400000000

```

### Daily Active Addresses

This metric includes the number of unique addresses that participated in the transfers of given token during the day. In order to access real time data, you'll need to set the [api key](#configuration) and have some SAN tokens in your account.

```python
daa = san.get(
    "daily_active_addresses/santiment",
    from_date="2018-06-01",
    to_date="2018-06-05",
    interval="1d"
)
```

Example result:

```
                           activeAddresses
datetime
2018-06-01 00:00:00+00:00                2
2018-06-02 00:00:00+00:00                4
2018-06-03 00:00:00+00:00                6
2018-06-04 00:00:00+00:00                6
2018-06-05 00:00:00+00:00               14
```

### Network Growth

Network Growth shows the number of new addresses being created on the project network each day.
In order to access real time data or historical data (older than 3 months), you'll need to set the [api key](#configuration) and have some SAN tokens in your account.

```python
san.get(
    "network_growth/santiment",
    from_date="2018-12-01",
    to_date="2018-12-05"
)
```

```
                          newAddresses
datetime
2018-12-01 00:00:00+00:00            3
2018-12-02 00:00:00+00:00            2
2018-12-03 00:00:00+00:00            6
2018-12-04 00:00:00+00:00            2
2018-12-05 00:00:00+00:00            1
```

### Burn Rate - deprecated, replaced by 'Token Age Consumed'

Each transaction has an equivalent burn rate record. The burn rate is calculated by multiplying the number of tokens moved by the number of blocks in which they appeared. Spikes in burn rate could indicate large transactions or movement of tokens that have been held for a long time. In order to access real time data or historical data (older than 3 months), you'll need to set the [api key](#configuration) and have some SAN tokens in your account.

Burn rate returns the same results as 'Token Age Consumed' and will be removed in the near future.
```python
burn_rate = san.get(
    "burn_rate/santiment",
    from_date="2018-05-01",
    to_date="2018-05-05",
    interval="1d"
)
```

Example result:

```
                               burnRate
datetime                                   
2018-05-01 00:00:00+00:00      2.514926e+09
2018-05-02 00:00:00+00:00      1.363158e+10
2018-05-03 00:00:00+00:00      2.182971e+09
2018-05-04 00:00:00+00:00      9.731035e+09
2018-05-05 00:00:00+00:00      2.867054e+10
```

### Token Age Consumed

Each transaction has an equivalent 'Age consumed' record. The consumed age is calculated by multiplying the number of tokens moved by the number of blocks in which they appeared. Spikes in consumed token age could indicate large transactions or movement of tokens that have been held for a long time. In order to access real time data or historical data (older than 3 months), you'll need to set the [api key](#configuration) and have some SAN tokens in your account.

```python
token_age_consumed = san.get(
    "token_age_consumed/santiment",
    from_date="2018-05-01",
    to_date="2018-05-05",
    interval="1d"
)
```

Example result:

```
                           tokenAgeConsumed
datetime                                   
2018-05-01 00:00:00+00:00      2.514926e+09
2018-05-02 00:00:00+00:00      1.363158e+10
2018-05-03 00:00:00+00:00      2.182971e+09
2018-05-04 00:00:00+00:00      9.731035e+09
2018-05-05 00:00:00+00:00      2.867054e+10
```

### Average Token Age Consumed in Days

Based on 'Token Age Consumed' above, this returns the Token Age that gets consumed on average over the interval. The result is given in days instead of blocks. In order to access real time data or historical data (older than 3 months), you'll need to set the [api key](#configuration) and have some SAN tokens in your account.

```python
average_token_age_consumed_in_days = san.get(
    "average_token_age_consumed_in_days/santiment",
    from_date="2018-05-01",
    to_date="2018-05-05",
    interval="1d"
)
```

Example result:

```
                             tokenAge
datetime                             
2018-05-01 00:00:00+00:00    6.353738
2018-05-02 00:00:00+00:00   22.303985
2018-05-03 00:00:00+00:00    3.873644
2018-05-04 00:00:00+00:00  140.566428
2018-05-05 00:00:00+00:00   56.730010
```


### Transaction Volume

Total amount of tokens for a project that were transacted on the blockchain. This metric includes only on-chain volume, not volume in exchanges. In order to access real time data or historical data (older than 3 months), you'll need to set the [api key](#configuration) and have some SAN tokens in your account.

```python
tv = san.get(
    "transaction_volume/santiment",
    from_date="2018-05-01",
    to_date="2018-05-02",
    interval="1h"
)
```

Example result:

```
                           transactionVolume
datetime
2018-05-01 11:00:00+00:00         298.707310

2018-05-01 22:00:00+00:00       41397.348795
2018-05-01 23:00:00+00:00         300.000000
```

### Token Velocity

Token Velocity returns the average number of times that a token changes wallets over the interval.

Simply put, a higher token velocity means that the same token is used in transactions more often within a set time frame. In order to access real time data or historical data (older than 3 months), you'll need to set the [api key](#configuration) and have some SAN tokens in your account.

```python
token_velocity = san.get(
    "token_velocity/santiment",
    from_date="2018-06-01",
    to_date="2018-06-05",
    interval="1d")
```

Example result:

```
                           tokenVelocity
datetime                                
2018-06-01 00:00:00+00:00           1.00
2018-06-02 00:00:00+00:00           3.00
2018-06-03 00:00:00+00:00           1.97
2018-06-04 00:00:00+00:00           1.00
2018-06-05 00:00:00+00:00           2.92
```

### Token Circulation

Token Circulation returns the total amount of tokens that have been sent at least once during each given time period. Minimum interval is '1d'. In order to access real time data or historical data (older than 3 months), you'll need to set the [api key](#configuration) and have some SAN tokens in your account.

```python
token_circulation = san.get(
    "token_circulation/santiment",
    from_date="2018-06-01",
    to_date="2018-06-05",
    interval="1d"
```

Example result:

```
                           tokenCirculation
datetime

2018-06-05 00:00:00+00:00      14678.249398
```

### Realized Value

Realized Value returns the total acquisition cost of all tokens on the network, based on the historical price when each coin was last sent, in USD. Returns RV for all tokens and RV for all tokens known to be on exchanges. In order to access real time data or historical data (older than 3 months), you'll need to set the [api key](#configuration) and have some SAN tokens in your account.

```python
realized_value = san.get(
    "realized_value/santiment",
    from_date="2018-05-01",
    to_date="2018-06-05",
    interval="1w"
```

Example result:

```

### MVRV Ratio

MVRV ratio returns the ratio of the market value of all tokens (market cap) to the realized value of all tokens. In order to access real time data or historical data (older than 3 months), you'll need to set the [api key](#configuration) and have some SAN tokens in your account.

```python
mvrv_ratio = san.get(
    "mvrv_ratio/santiment",
    from_date="2018-06-01",
    to_date="2018-06-05",
    interval="1d"
```

Example result:

```
                              ratio
datetime

2018-06-05 00:00:00+00:00  0.781964
```

### NVT Ratio

NVT ratio returns the Network-Value-to-Transactions ratio. We use the market cap as network value and either token circulation or transaction volume as a measurement for transactions, returning two values. In order to access real time data or historical data (older than 3 months), you'll need to set the [api key](#configuration) and have some SAN tokens in your account.

```python
nvt_ratio = san.get(
    "nvt_ratio/santiment",
    from_date="2018-06-01",
    to_date="2018-06-05",
    interval="1d"
```

### Daily Active Deposits

Daily Active Deposits, similar to Daily Active Addresses, returns the number of unique addresses that participated in the transfers of tokens to exchange deposit addresses during the day. In order to access real time data or historical data (older than 3 months), you'll need to set the [api key](#configuration) and have some SAN tokens in your account.

```python
daily_active_deposits = san.get(
    "daily_active_deposits/santiment",
    from_date="2018-06-01",
    to_date="2018-06-05",
    interval="1d"
```

Example result:

```
                           activeDeposits
datetime

### Github Activity

Returns a list of github activity for a given slug and time interval. In order to access real time data, you'll need to set the [api key](#configuration) and have some SAN tokens in your account.

[An article explaining the github activity tracking](https://medium.com/santiment/tracking-github-activity-of-crypto-projects-introducing-a-better-approach-9fb1af3f1c32)

```python
ga = san.get(
    "github_activity/santiment",
    from_date="2018-05-01",
    to_date="2018-05-05",
    interval="24h"
)
```

Example result:

```
                           activity
